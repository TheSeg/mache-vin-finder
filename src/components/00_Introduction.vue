      <h1>Ford Mach-E Reservation Details Viewer</h1>
      <p>This is a tool helps obtain various information from your Mach-E reservation that is sent to your browser, but not displayed. Espeically the VIN number, if your order has a build week set. Created by <a href="https://seg.fyi/" target="_blank">John "Seg" Seggerson</a>.</p>
      <h2 class="text-danger">Disclaimers!</h2>
      <p><strong>This tool is not from Ford.</strong> Use at your own risk, etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Data you enter stays on your computer.</strong> I've done my best to preserve your privacy as much as possiable. No data is sent from your browser to this or any other website. Not even analytics.</p>
      <p>The software source code is <a href="https://github.com/TheSeg/mache-vin-finder" target="_blank">located on my GitHub</a>. If you're adventerous, you can run it on your computer yourself! <a href="https://github.com/TheSeg/mache-vin-finder/issues" target="_blank">I'm open to improvments</a>, but ultimately this site is AS-IS.</p>
